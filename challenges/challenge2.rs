/* 1. The "trim_space" function
@args:   &str (string slice)
@return: &str (string slice)

Task: Remove all leading and trailing whitespace.
Example: assert_eq!(trim_space("   test   "), "test");

Hint: A built-in method exists, but you can try to 
manually find the start and end indices for the slice!

/* 2. The "low_caps" function
@args:    &str (string slice)
@returns: String (owned string)

Task: Convert the entire string to lowercase.
Example: assert_eq!(low_caps("LIfe IS Good"), "life is good");

Hint: Rust strings are UTF-8. Using a built-in method is 
highly recommended, as manual implementation is complex!

/* 3. The "cocktail" function
@args:    String
@returns: String

Task: Combine the two previous functions.
The result should be a string with no trailing 
spaces and all lowercase letters.
